      <description>Building a second brain Recently I have discovered the value of offloading information from my mind to my second brain. Inspired by Tiago Forte book Building a Second Brain
Why a second brain? A second brain is a personal knowledge management system that supports offloading information and als improves information retrieval and memory recall.

      <description>Some common math coding exercises used as interview programming questions
isPrime An algorigthm to compute a Prime Number which is greater than 1 and only divisbile by one and itself. For example Prime numbers are 1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17..
Problem: Given a number n the function must determine if n is prime and return true/false.
1boolean isPrime(int n) { 2 for (int x=2; x*x &amp;lt;=n; x++) { 3 if (n % x == 0) { 4 return false; 5 } 6 } 7 return true; 8} Time Complexity: Analyzing this code fragment has a time complexity of o(n/2)</description>
