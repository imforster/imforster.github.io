      <description>Some common math coding exercises used as interview programming questions
isPrime An algorigthm to compute a Prime Number which is greater than 1 and only divisbile by one and itself. For example Prime numbers are 1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17..
Problem: Given a number n the function must determine if n is prime and return true/false.
1boolean isPrime(int n) { 2 for (int x=2; x*x &amp;lt;=n; x++) { 3 if (n % x == 0) { 4 return false; 5 } 6 } 7 return true; 8} Time Complexity: Analyzing this code fragment has a time complexity of o(n/2)</description>

      <description>Why create a Bullet journal About a year and half ago I was introduced to the concept of the Bullet Journal as a GTD tool. As a software engineer one might wonder why an analog tool. The simplicity of a notebook that is follows the Buillet Journal structure as outline below.
A key aspect that I appreciate is the Index structure allows me to quickly navigate. No blue-light making it a great way to review tasks.</description>
